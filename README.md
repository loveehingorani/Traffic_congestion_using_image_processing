# Traffic_congestion_using_image_processing

This is a project in which a pretrained detection model to detect bikes and cars in a frame is used. A video frame is siezed first and then using these models detect the staring and ending bounding box coordinates.

bikes.py - This file will only detect two-whellers in an video.
cars.py - This detects four or more whellers from video.

main.py - This is a combined file to generate cars and bike coordinates and bounding boxes. It also gives the total number of cars or bikes that had been passed.
